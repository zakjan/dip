\section{Cipher suites}

TLS is great in flexibility which provides for using various cryptographic primitives in a common framework. A selection of cryptographic primitives and their parameters is called \textit{cipher suite}.

A cipher suite is defined roughly by the following attributes:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Key exchange algorithm
  \item Authentication algorithm
  \item Encryption algorithm
  \begin{itemize}
    \item cipher algorithm
    \item key size
    \item cipher mode
  \end{itemize}
  \item MAC algorithm
  \item Pseudorandom function
\end{itemize}

Cipher suite names are usually long, descriptive and consistent. They are made from names of the key exchange method, authentiction method, encryption method and optional MAC or PRF algorithm.
