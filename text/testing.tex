\todo{compile a server and a client app with my edited library}
\todo{configure server to use the new cipher}
\todo{watch network traffic between them with Wireshark, confirm it is used}

All benchmarks were taken on a computer with the following configuration: CPU Intel Core i5-2540M (AES-NI, AVX capable), RAM 8 GB, OS Linux Fedora 21 (kernel 3.17.7, 64 bit).
