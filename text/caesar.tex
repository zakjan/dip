\chapter{Competition for Authenticated Encryption: Security, Applicability and Robustness}

In 2013, CAESAR was announced. It is a worldwide cryptographic competition, focused on finding new methods of authenticated encryption, that offer advantages against commonly used AES-GCM and will be suitable for widespread adoption. Submitted algorithms will be publicly evaluated by committee of researchers in fields of cryptography and cryptoanalysis.

This competition follows a long tradition of focused competitions in secret-key cryptography:

\begin{itemize}
  \item In 1997, United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced an open competition for a new symmetric cupher, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). This competition attracted 15 submissions from 50 cryptographers around the world. In the end, Rijndael was chosen as AES.
  \item In 2004, European Network of Excellence in Cryptology (ECRYPT) announced the ECRYPT Stream Cipher Project (eSTREAM), a call for new stream ciphers suitable for widespread adoption. This call attracted 34 submissions from 100 cryptographers around the world. In the end, the eSTREAM committee selected a portfolio containing several stream ciphers.
  \item In 2007, NIST announced an open competition for a new hash standard to Secure Hash Algorithm family (SHA-3). This competition attracted 64 submissions from 200 cryptographers around the world. In the end, Keccak was chosen as SHA-3.
\end{itemize}

All past cryptographic competitions attracted many submissions from cryptographers around the world, and then even more security and performance evaluations from cryptanalysts. They are generally viewed as having provided a tremendous boost to the cryptographic research community's understanding of underlying concepts, and a tremendous increase in confidence in the security of some existing cryptosystems. Similar comments are expected to apply to CAESAR. \cite{crypto-competitions}
