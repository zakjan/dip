\section{Selection}
\label{toc/caesar-selection}

Because in the time of writing this thesis the announcement of second-round candidates is still being postponed, I could not choose a qualified candidate, which I would implement into OpenSSL. So I decided to implement a cipher using the generic CAESAR API (see \autoref{toc/caesar-api}).

As a reference cipher for my implementation part I chose the NORX cipher, because it have received no negative analysis. However it is not important which particular cipher I used, because the cipher can be easily switched for a different cipher complying with the CAESAR API, as soon as the the second-round candidate or final announcement will be made.
