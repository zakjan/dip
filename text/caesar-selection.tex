\section{Selection}
\label{toc/caesar-selection}

Because the announcement of second-round candidates is in the time of writing this thesis still being postponed, I couldn't choose a well-rated candidate, which I would implement into OpenSSL. So I decided to implement a generic cipher using the CAESAR API (see \autoref{toc/caesar-api}).

As a reference cipher for my implementation part I chose NORX. It is not important which particular cipher I used, because the cipher can be easily switched for a different cipher complying with the CAESAR API, as soon as the the second-round candidate or final announcement will be made.
