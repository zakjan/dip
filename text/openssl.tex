\chapter{OpenSSL}

OpenSSL\footnote{\url{https://www.openssl.org}} is an opensource cryptographic toolkit, consisting of implementations of many cryptographic aslgorithms, all versions of TLS protocol and various command-line tools.

It is free to get and use for both non-commercial and commercial purposes, with some simple licence conditions\footnote{\url{https://www.openssl.org/source/license.html}}.

OpenSSL provides two libraries, \texttt{libssl} and \texttt{libcrypto}. \texttt{libssl} is responsible for SSL/TLS protocol, also with other supportive functions such as parsing and validating X509 certificates.
